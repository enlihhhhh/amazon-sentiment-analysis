Testing your tracker is the best way to find out where it will work best for you.Next, a second signal is sent from the tracking unit to our servers; using cellular networks for real time tracking. When no cellular signal is available the Tracking Unit will save the track in its memory until it regains signal. Battery charge can last up to 2 weeks depending on use. You can set a low battery alerts.Lastly, you will access all this information through the custom Smart Phone App or tracking website with Google Maps.Sometimes you may get a drift on the map position if the Tracking Unit is placed in a much concealed location or indoors.Please be aware that the signal will not work if the Tracker is totally enclosed in metal or inside buildings.Frequent position report updates are available but will use more battery charge.SIM Card included Accessories sold separately: Optimus Twin Magnet GPS Tracker Case.
