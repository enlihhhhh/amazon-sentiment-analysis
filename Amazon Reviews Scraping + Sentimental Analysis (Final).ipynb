I watched a couple of movies and played Tomb Rider on it. The true black of an OLED screen drastically increases the atmoshpere and fidelity of the gaming experience (i.e. dark caves, shadows and lights in the forest, etc.).\\n\\nThe secondary screen, named I think ScreenPad, is of equal high resolution, yet not as shiny as the main one. But any complaint about it seems preposterous, since the dual-screen functionality is aimed at unmatched productivity, and in this regard the secondary screen fully exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nBoth screens are touchscreen. The experience of writing with the Asus Pen seems much better than what I experienced with the Microsoft Surface, which was somewhat more slippery.\\n\\nOn having the mousepad on the right, I got used to it easily and, the addition of a small mouse surely reduces any remaining frustration. When I compared the purchased of a traditional laptop with this dual-screen, the on-the-go productivity offered by the DUO obliterated any other consideration.\\n\\nAs commented elsewhere, the product is advertised as having 2Tb SSD. Disappointingly, it comes with 1Tb SSD. Surely, it is something to complain with Amazon but the issue does not reduce the quality of the DUO, as a product. On the plus side, the DUO is fully accessible and the HD can be switched easily with any larger size SSDs (just check online for best compatibility and price).\\n\\nOn why I made this purchase, I wanted to move over from several generations of Microsoft Surfaces and I was looking for more power, similar lightweight portability, touchscreen, and pen capabilities.\\nThe Zenbook Duo 14 answered all my requirements.

I watched a couple of movies and played Tomb Rider on it. The true black of an OLED screen drastically increases the atmoshpere and fidelity of the gaming experience (i.e. dark caves, shadows and lights in the forest, etc.).\\n\\nThe secondary screen, named I think ScreenPad, is of equal high resolution, yet not as shiny as the main one. But any complaint about it seems preposterous, since the dual-screen functionality is aimed at unmatched productivity, and in this regard the secondary screen fully exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nBoth screens are touchscreen. The experience of writing with the Asus Pen seems much better than what I experienced with the Microsoft Surface, which was somewhat more slippery.\\n\\nOn having the mousepad on the right, I got used to it easily and, the addition of a small mouse surely reduces any remaining frustration. When I compared the purchased of a traditional laptop with this dual-screen, the on-the-go productivity offered by the DUO obliterated any other consideration.\\n\\nAs commented elsewhere, the product is advertised as having 2Tb SSD.
